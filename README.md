## About the Project

In this project, I will build an SQL database from scratch, create tables, define relationships, and insert data to perform in-depth analysis. Using both SQL and Python, I'll explore how these tools work together to generate insights for managers. I'll work with five tables—games, players, game prices, countries, and purchase games—using VS Code as our IDE, connecting to an SQL Server, and handling Parquet files. In the end, I used Python to perform Statistical Analysis.
